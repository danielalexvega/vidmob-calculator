# VidMob Calculator

Please download, do an npm install, and enjoy. 

## Features

This little calculator can add, subtract, multiply, divide, do modulus, and even factorials. 

The biggest issue with this problem was figuring out how to simplify solving equations. As a former math teacher, I found it was a little more tricky than I would have initially thought. 

I had a lot of fun on this project. I hope you enjoy my parks and rec reference. 

I look forward to discussing my thought process.
